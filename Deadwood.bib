  abstract = {Competition is known to be a key driver of plant population dynamics. However, understanding how different types of competitive processes interact with population structure in driving population dynamics remains challenging. Ecologists broadly distinguish between two types of competition: size-asymmetric competition (SAC), related to resource pre-emption, and size-symmetric competition (SSC), related to resource depletion. SAC and SSC are known to influence plant-size population structures differently. Usually, SAC increases size inequality and, in return, changes in size inequality reinforce the role of SAC. On the contrary, SSC generally triggers size structure homogeneity. Although numerous simulations and experimental studies have explored how SAC influences population size structure, there is still no clear way to estimate the reverse effect: how changes in the size structure of a population affects the role of SAC compared to SSC in plant growth. In this article, we propose a modelling approach to estimate how size structure influences the role SAC plays in growth in mono-specific forest stands. First, we show that the role of SAC can be assessed by an equation that involves the Gini index, a well-known size inequality index. We then apply our approach to national forest inventory data in France, focusing on two major species: European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and silver fir (Abies alba Mill.). This article discusses the conditions necessary to apply such a modelling approach and gives perspectives for further development in plant ecology.},

  abstract = {Volume or biomass estimates of downed woody debris are crucial for numerous applications such as forest carbon stock assessment, biodiversity assessments, and more recently for environmental evaluations of biofuel harvesting practices. Both fixed-area sampling (FAS) and line-intersect sampling (LIS) are used in forest inventories and ecological studies because they are unbiased and accurate methods. Nevertheless, most studies and inventories take into account only coarse woody debris (CWD, {$>$}10 cm in diameter), although fine woody debris (FWD) can account for a large part of the total downed biomass. We compared the LIS and FAS methods for FWD volume or biomass estimates and evaluated the influence of diameter and wood density measurements, plot number and size. We used a Test Zone (a defined surface area where a complete inventory was carried out, in addition to FAS and LIS), a Pilot Stand (a forest stand where both LIS and FAS methods were applied) and results from 10 field inventories in deciduous temperate forest stands with various conditions and amounts of FWD. Both methods, FAS and LIS, provided accurate (in trueness and precision) volume estimates, but LIS proved to be the more efficient. Diameter measurement was the main source of error: using the mean diameter, even by diameter class, led to an error for volume estimates of around 35\%. On the contrary, wood density measurements can be simplified without much influence on the accuracy of biomass estimates (use of mean density by diameter class). We show that the length and number of transects greatly influences the estimates, and that it is better to apply more, shorter transects than fewer, longer ones. Finally, we determined the optimal methodology and propose a simplification of some measurements to obtain the best time-precision trade-off for FWD inventories at the stand level.},

  abstract = {More attention has been given to tree size diversity in boreal forests over the past few years, mainly because of increased focus on uneven-aged forest management, biodiversity and social values. Objective measures of tree size diversity are needed in order to develop management plans that are sustainable with respect to ecological and economical values. The objective of the present study was to evaluate different indices describing diameter diversity based on criteria related to applications in forest management planning. Eight previously described indices were evaluated based on 16 simulated and 174 empirical diameter distributions. The Gini coefficient was found superior with respect to discriminant ability, capability of providing logical ranking of different distributions and sensitivity to variation in sample size. There is a wide range of possible applications of the Gini coefficient in forest management planning, e.g. to compare tree size diversity in different stands, to assess changes in tree size diversity over time, to quantify the influence of different silvicultural treatments on tree size diversity and to assess areas suitable for certain silvicultural treatments. The coefficient can also be used as an integrated part of growth simulators in order to control the silvicultural treatments in projections.},

  abstract = {A method for estimating wood volume on the ground is described. It requires only a diameter tally of pieces intersected by a sample line, and application of a simple formula. Theory for the formula is presented, and practical application discussed. The effect of bias in orientation of wood pieces can be largely overcome by running sample lines in two or more directions. The method was demonstrated indoors with match splints scattered on a 54-inch square and tested on a 20-acre cutover area. It has potential value for measuring fuel quantities in fire research.}
